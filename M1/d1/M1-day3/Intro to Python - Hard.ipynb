If you don't finish all the exercises, you can work on them tonightor tomorrow. \n\nAt the end of the class, we will upload the code with the solutions of the exercises so that you can review them again if needed. If you still have not finished some exercises, try to do them first by yourself, before taking a look at the solutions: you are doing these exercises for yourself, so it is always the best to do them your way first, as it is the fastest way to learn!","metadata":{"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","cell_id":"00000-e13641ca-4546-489c-b51b-f46f7f5bcb81"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Exercise 4.1 (üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è):** Define a function that receives a string parameter, and returns an integer indicating the count for all the letters of the alphabet that there are in the string.
