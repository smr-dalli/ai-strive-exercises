        <li>Reviews:<br>
            I joined Strive school's 6 month MERN stack course with no prior experience in programming.
            The course completely exceeded my expectations - the level of support provided by tutors and fellow classmates was exceptional.
            All of the teachers are amazing and bring a unique set of skills to the table. What I enjoyed the most was that Strive does not only teach coding, but also put major emphases on harnessing soft skills, learning how to work in a team and how to brand/present yourself - all the things needed to be able to actually get a job and work in a professional environment.
