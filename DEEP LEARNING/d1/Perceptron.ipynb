You can think of them like the features of the data you have worked on till now. Do you remember the *wonderful features* of the build week you worked on without knowing what they stand for? Those anonymous columns? Yes, like those.\n\nYou investigated them trying to see the \"importance\" of each one using the correlation with the target, or the *shap* values. \nWell, a neuron try to figure out the importance of each input feature by itself. How?\n\nLook at those $w_{1}, w_{2},..., w_{n}$: they are the *weigths* that are associated with each input entry. As you can see on the right part of the picture, each $x_{i}$ is multiplied by the corresponding $w_{i}$ and then summed together. Those weights are not there to indicate the \"importance\" of each input feature, but instead the goal is to build a binary classifier, as you can expect from the 0 and 1 in the picture above. \n\nOk, restart. The goal of a perceptron is to build a binary classifier, meaning a classifier that outputs either 0 or 1. In the case of a neuron, it \"spikes\" electricity through the axons, or doesn't. \n\nFor this reason, the $w_{i}$s are the weights, either positive or negative, such that the weighted sum $\\sum_{i}w_{i}\\cdot x_{i}$ gives either 0 or 1. What does $b$ stand for? As you can expect, it's the bias component that you are used to already.\n\nI'll give you another example. Think that you want to decide either to watch a specific movie or not. You could have some \"features\" that you may consider before taking the decision. Let's say they are three:\n- $x_{1}$ is the feature: isAvengersMovie\n- $x_{2}$ is the feature: isRomanticMovie\n- $x_{3}$ is the feature: theMovieWonAnOscar\n\nWhat about the *bias*? Well, maybe a movie freak would watch all the movies he could, a more selective one would watch only Avengers movies. But at the end of the day, the weights and the bias will depend on the data.

So let's start from the first sample, the \"Titanic\" movie. We have to compute:\n\n$x_{1}\\cdot w_{1} + x_{2}\\cdot w_{2} +  x_{3}\\cdot w_{3} + b$ \n\nApproximating $w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, b$ to the third significant figure, and remembering that $x_{1} = 1, x_{2} = 0, x_{3}=0$, we have:\n$0.374\\cdot 0 - 1.901 \\cdot 1 + 0.732\\cdot 1 + 0.374 = - 0.795$.\n\nNow what? The result is neither 0 or 1! This is why we need an *activation function*! An activation function determines whether the neuron should be activated (“fired”) or not, based on whether each neuron's input is relevant for the model's prediction. The most *basic* activation function you can think of is the one that gives you 1 in case of a positive outcome, 0 for 0 or negative one. In mathematical terms, if $g(\\mathbf{x})$ is the activation function given the input vector $\\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},x_{2}, x_{3})$\n\n$$ g(\\mathbf{x})=\\begin{cases}\n          1, & \\text{if}\\ \\mathbf{wx}+\\mathbf{b}>0 \\\\\n          0, & \\text{otherwise}\n            \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nI used another notation here, just to make you flexible for different book notations. In some books, to distinguish scalars from vectors (*i.e.* simple numbers like 1, 1.5, -1 from (2, 1, 3.6)) it is used the bold for vectors. I recall you that $\\mathbf{wx}$ is the *dot product* between $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$!\n\nOk cool, what about the output of our algorithm for the \"Titanic\"? Since the output of $0.374\\cdot 0 - 1.901 \\cdot 1 + 0.732\\cdot 1 + 0.374 = - 0.795$ is negative, the activation function $g$ will make it 0.\n\nOh, but this is a wrong prediction!

Perceptron Learning Rule!\nSince the prediction was 0 instead of 1.\nWhat we wished for, was the dot product $\\mathbf{wx}$ to be higher than 0, because in this way the activation function would have returned 1! Since we got a negative value, we need to edit the weights a bit so that we are more likely to get a positive value for classifying this example and get the right score. \n\nIs it clear? I'll say it again: we predicted 0 instead of 1. We predicted 0 because $\\mathbf{wx}=-0.795$ and the activation function $g$ states that we say \"0\" if $\\mathbf{wx}$ is negative, so this is the case. If we want a positive outcome from $\\mathbf{wx}$, then we should increase a bit that value. How can we? We decided the old weights just randomly picking them, so can adjust them such that $\\mathbf{wx}$ for the \"Titanic\" example will be higher!\n\nUnpacking the dot product $\\mathbf{wx}$ for each component:\n\n- $w_{1}\\cdot x_{1}$ \n- $w_{2}\\cdot x_{2}$\n- $w_{2}\\cdot x_{3}$\n\nSince the $x_{i}$ are \"fixed\", they are given from the dataset, we can increase the $w_{i}$ like:\n\n$$w_{i(new)} = w_{i(old)} + (y-\\hat{y})x_{i}$$\n\nIn this way: if we have no error, it means that $(y-\\hat{y})=0$, so we don't make any update. If we predicted 0 and the label was 1, then we have $1-0=1$ and $w_{i(new)}$ would become $w_{i(old)}+x_{i}$. If we predicted 1 and the label was 0, then $0-1= -1$ and $w_{i(new)}$ would become $w_{i(old)}-x_{i}$.\n\nIn our example:\n\n- $w_{1(new)} = 0.374 + 0 = 0.374$\n- $w_{2(new)} = -1.901 + 1 = -0.901$\n- $w_{2(new)} = 0.732 + 1 = 1.732$\n- $b_{(new)} = 0.374 + 1 = 1.374$\n\nIf we try the prediction again:\n\n$0.374\\cdot 0 - 0.901 \\cdot 1 + 1.732\\cdot 1 + 1.374 = 2.749$.\n\n*N.B.* To learn the bias as well, we add another component to the input and we consider it as 1.

you can see in the picture above, we have a jump at 0. However, you may expect not so big difference between -0.001 and 0.001! As we did for the Logistic Regression, we may use the *sigmoid* or *logistic function* as activation function to have a smoother behaviour:","metadata":{"cell_id":"00044-44bf5909-1645-4266-9e0b-47c7d0a73cec","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*QLtPF0YkwYRLVoSeh2w4gw.png)","metadata":{"cell_id":"00045-374757a0-7978-4379-b32c-2c9a1487aaef","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this way, the output won't be either 0 or 1, but the probability (because we have a continuous number between 0 and 1) of 0 or 1!\n\nLet's implement the perceptron again but using the sigmoid this time:","metadata":{"cell_id":"00046-2647db99-ed4a-4579-b474-9776a84789d4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"00047-fe6a2fe8-9526-40a5-ae8a-25e1cca67202","deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"source_hash":"1cc4a880","execution_start":1614001013387,"execution_millis":3,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"def sigmoid(x):\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n\ndef perceptron_with_sigmoid(train, weights, bias, eta, max_iter):\n    it = 0\n    while it < max_iter: \n        new_weights = weights\n        new_bias = bias\n        for sample in train:\n            output = np.dot(weights, sample[0]) + bias \n            ## I comment the old activation function\n            # if output <= 0:\n            #     output = 0\n            # else:\n            #     output = 1\n            ## New activation function\n            output = sigmoid(output)\n            if (sample[1] - output) != 0:\n                \n                weights += eta*(sample[1] - output)*sample[0]\n                bias += eta*(sample[1] - output)\n        if new_weights.all() == weights.all() and new_bias == bias:\n            print(f\"Convergence achieved at iteration {it}\")\n            break\n        it += 1\n        \n    return weights, bias\n\n","execution_count":53,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You will see later why that having such a smooth and differentiable function helps neural network for computing the gradient of the loss function! \n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe have seen the Perceptron algorithm, that is an algorithm to build a binary classifier for linearly separable data. We succesfully tested it on an example movies dataset, and unsuccesfully for the XOR problem, that contains not-linearly separable data. \n\nWe learned that the Perceptron is for an artificial neural network what a neuron is for a biological one. We defined the sigmoid, a smooth and differentiable activation function that is often used in neural networks (you will meet cooler activation functions by the way!).\n\nFor questions, feel free to ask!
