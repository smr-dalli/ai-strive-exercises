## Exercises

### ‚ùì Missing values

1. What is the missing datatype used in pandas?
Ans: np.NaN,empty strings and constants. 

2. How to replace all occurences of the value 9999 to missing in pandas?
Ans: Replace the 9999 to np.NaN

3. How to get the absolute number of missings for each variable in pandas?
Ans: df.column.isna().sum()

4. How to get the percentage of missings for each variable in pandas?
Ans: df.column_name.isna().sum() / len(df.column_name)

5. How to drop rows with missing values?
Ans: 1. Directly drop the rows with missing values. df.dropna(axis = 1)
     2. Imputation.
     from Sklearn import impute.SimpleImputer(strategy = ['constant','mean','median','most frequent'])
     Also, for constant, replace the value with out of feature range such as num: -999,-1,cat: 'missing_value'.
     3. Using Model such as XGBoost,LightGBM

6. How to drop variables with missing values?
Ans: 1. Directly drop the rows with missing values. df.dropna(axis = 0)
     2. Imputation.
     from Sklearn import impute.SimpleImputer(strategy = ['constant','mean','median','most frequent'])
     Also, for constant, replace the value with out of feature range such as num: -999,-1,cat: 'missing_value'.
     3. Using Model such as XGBoost,LightGBM

7. What is the univariate imputation method in sklearn?
Ans: 1. Imputation.
     from Sklearn import impute.SimpleImputer(strategy = ['constant','mean','median','most frequent'])
     Also, for constant, replace the value with out of feature range such as num: -999,-1,cat: 'missing_value'.
     2. Using Model such as XGBoost,LightGBM

8. What is the multivariate imputation method in sklearn?
Ans: In the multivariate, we reconstruct the missing values based on the other variables.
     In, Scikit learn, we use impute.iterativeImputer() and impute.KNNimputer()

9. What is the best univariate imputation method to categorical variables? (Explain why)
Ans: Using the strategy, Replace the value with 'missing_value'

10. What is the best univariate imputation method to numerical variables? (Explain why)
Ans: Using the strategy, Replace the misising value with mean.
     Also, for Tree models, replacing with value that is out of range feature value such as -999,-1.


### üîé Outliers

1. What is an outlier?
Ans: An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from the actual observations. 

2. What is a simple method to detect and deal with outliers of a numerical variable?
Ans: We must remove otliers for the model accuracy. Plotting the distribution plot is the efficient method.

3. What is novelty detection?
Ans: Novelty detection is the task of classifying test data that differ in some respect from the data that are
 available during training

4. Name 4 advanced methods of outlier detection in sklearn.
Ans: Robust Covariance
     One Class svm
     Isolation Forest
     Local outlier factor


### üñã Typos

1. What is a typo?
Ans: Errors during the data entry. Detection of the typos and correcting it must be done.

2. What is a good method of automatically detect typos?
Ans: Using FuzzyWuzzy that identifies typos automatically and fixes it.



### Practical case

Consider the following dataset: [San Francisco Building Permits](https://www.kaggle.com/aparnashastry/building-permit-applications-data). Look at the columns "Street Number Suffix" and "Zipcode". Both of these contain missing values.

- Which, if either, are missing because they don't exist?
- Which, if either, are missing because they weren't recorded?

Hint: Do all addresses generally have a street number suffix? Do all addresses generally have a zipcode?

Ans: 
Code:
miss_val = df['Street Number Suffix'].isna().sum() / len(df)
print(f'Missing value percentage of Street Number Suffix column is:{round(miss_val*100,2)}')
missing_val = df['Zipcode'].isna().sum() / len(df)
print(f'Missing value percentage of Zipcode column is:{round(missing_val*100,2)}')

Result: 
Missing value percentage of Street Number Suffix column is:98.89
Missing value percentage of Zipcode column is:0.86

Conclusion:
There are a lot of missing values in Street Number Suffix column, There exists few suffix but not recorded.
They were not recorded in Zipcode column.
