      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\n",

      "They attacked him\n",
      "in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\n",

      "admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\n",
      "which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\n",
      "proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\n",

      "to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.\n",
      "Mr. Collins, however,\n",
      "was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\n",

      "made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.\n",
      "She saw her in idea settled in\n",

      "but\n",
      "three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\n",

      "It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n",

      "preparing to oblige the company.\n",
      "By many significant looks and silent\n",

      "That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",

      "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n",
      "particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\n",

      "him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n",

      "\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\n",
      "my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\n",
      "the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\n",
      "disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n",

      "\"\n",
      "Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",

      "room, handsomely fitted up.\n",
      "Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect.\n",
      "The hill, crowned with wood, which\n",
      "they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\n",
      "was a beautiful object.\n",
      "Every disposition of the ground was good; and\n",
      "she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\n",
      "banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\n",
      "with delight.\n",
      "As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\n",
      "different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\n",
      "seen.\n",
      "The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\n",
      "\n",
      "the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\n",
      "his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\n",
      "splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\n",
      "And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress!\n",

      "Instead of\n",
      "\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.\n",
      "But no,\"--recollecting\n",
      "herself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n",
      "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "absent, but had not the courage for it.\n",
      "At length however, the question\n",
      "was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\n",
      "Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \"\n",

      "over the mantelpiece.\n",
      "Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\n",
      "gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\n",
      "up by him at his own expense. \"\n",
      "He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\n",

      "Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",

      "\n",
      "\"\n",
      "He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\n",

      "There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\n",
      "him a good name.\n",
      "Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\n",

      "\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\n",

      "last at Pemberley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\n",
      "all that remained to be shown.\n",
      "In the former were many good paintings;\n",
      "\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
      "Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
      "also more intelligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger.\n",
      "Elizabeth walked in quest of\n",
      "\n",
      "the only face whose features would be known to her.\n",
      "At last it arrested\n",
      "her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\n",
      "smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\n",
      "looked at her.\n",
      "She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\n",
      "contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\n",
      "lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\n",
      "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\n",
      "their acquaintance.\n",
      "The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
      "\n",
      "was of no trifling nature.\n",
      "What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
      "of an intelligent servant?\n",
      "As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
      "considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\n",
      "\n",
      "good or evil must be done by him!\n",
      "Every idea that had been brought\n",
      "forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\n",
      "stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\n",
      "eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\n",
      "gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n",
      "softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\n",
      "was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.\n",
      "Their eyes\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\n",
      "blush.\n",
      "He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
      "of perfect civility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
      "overcome.\n",
      "Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise,\n",
      "on\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it.\n",
      "They stood a little\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\n",
      "\n",
      "she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.\n",
      "Amazed at the\n",
      "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\n",
      "he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind,\n",
      "the few\n",
      "minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\n",
      "her life.\n",
      "Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\n",
      "had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\n",
      "to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\n",
      "Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
      "leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\n",
      "Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\n",
      "followed them in silence.\n",
      "She was overpowered by shame and vexation.\n",
      "Her\n",
      "coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\n",
      "world!\n",
      "How strange it must appear to him!\n",
      "In what a disgraceful light\n",
      "might it not strike so vain a man!\n",
      "It might seem as if she had purposely\n",
      "thrown herself in his way again!\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "why did she come?\n",
      "Or, why did he\n",
      "thus come a day before he was expected?\n",
      "Had they been only ten minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\n",
      "\n",
      "for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\n",
      "from his horse or his carriage.\n",
      "She blushed again and again over\n",
      "the perverseness of the meeting.\n",
      "And his behaviour, so strikingly\n",
      "altered--what could it mean?\n",
      "That he should even speak to her\n",
      "was\n",
      "\n",
      "amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\n",
      "\n",
      "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\n",
      "had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "What\n",
      "\n",
      "a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\n",
      "his letter into her hand!\n",
      "She knew not what to think, or how to account\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
      "\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\n",
      "seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene.\n",
      "Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
      "was.\n",
      "She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
      "she was still dear to him.\n",
      "Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\n",
      "not like ease.\n",
      "Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\n",
      "seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
      "aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\n",
      "the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\n",
      "valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\n",
      "many, and occasionally part of the stream.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\n",
      "of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\n",
      "\n",
      "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\n",
      "brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\n",
      "to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed\n",
      "it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\n",
      "it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n",
      "valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\n",
      "and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\n",
      "bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\n",
      "of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Her niece was,\n",
      "\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\n",

      "approaching them, and at no great distance.\n",
      "The walk being here\n",
      "less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
      "they met.\n",
      "Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\n",
      "for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",

      "For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n",
      "The idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them.\n",
      "With a glance, she saw\n",
      "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\n",
      "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\n",
      "\n",
      "but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\n",
      "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\n",
      "Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.\n",
      "Her colour changed,\n",
      "\n",
      "and she said no more.\n",

      "could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
      "connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph.\n",
      "It was consoling that he should know she had\n",
      "some relations for whom there was no need to blush.\n",
      "She listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",

      "to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",

      "\n",
      "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\n",
      "must be all for herself.\n",
      "Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",

      "It originated\n",

      "in the country.\"\n",
      "He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\n",

      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.\n",
      "\"\n",
      "They\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.\n",

      "She immediately felt\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\n",
      "\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\n",

      "She wanted to talk, but\n",
      "there seemed to be an embargo on every subject.\n",
      "At last she recollected\n",
      "that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\n",

      "He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
      "speaks.\n",

      "as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\n",
      "his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
      "Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.\n",
      "In\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",

      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\n",
      "anything else.\n",
      "Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\n",

      "Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\n",
